"""Visual and behavioural proctoring beyond identity.

face.py answers "is it them, and are they alone". This module answers the
questions that catch the rest of the ways an interview gets cheated:

  * Is there a phone, a book or notes in shot?
  * Is the camera looking at a real person, or at a photo/screen/deepfake?
  * Are they reading something off to one side instead of looking ahead?
  * Is the screen they are sharing showing ChatGPT, search results or notes?

The first, second and fourth need to *understand* a picture, so they go to
Gemini Vision. The third is pure geometry and runs locally on landmarks the
face detector already produces — no extra model, no extra latency, no cost.

Everything here fails soft. A proctoring check that errors must never end
someone's interview, so every path returns "nothing detected" rather than
raising, and every result carries its own confidence for the caller to weigh.

# Gemini judges a picture, and pictures are ambiguous. Only act on a detection

# ── Gaze: are they reading something off-screen? ────────────────────────────
#
# YuNet already returns five landmarks per face (both eyes, nose, both mouth
# corners). Where the nose sits horizontally between the two eyes tells us which
# way the head is turned, with no extra model to load and nothing to send
# anywhere. It is a coarse signal — deliberately so. It cannot tell "glanced at
# the clock" from "read a note", which is exactly why a single frame never
# counts and the caller requires a sustained run of them.

# Nose offset from the eye midpoint, as a fraction of the inter-eye distance.
# A centred face sits near 0. Beyond this the head is clearly turned away.
_GAZE_TURN = 0.42
# Vertical is NOT symmetric with horizontal: on a normal face the nose tip
# already sits well below the eye line, so this offset has a large positive
# resting value (typically ~0.5-0.8 depending on the person and the camera
# angle) even when someone is looking straight ahead. Measuring "down" against
# a threshold near zero therefore flags everybody.
#
# It is measured against a resting baseline instead, and only a clear departure
# from that person's own neutral counts. Until enough samples exist to know
# their neutral, vertical gaze is not judged at all — which is why `direction`
# can be "center" on a frame whose raw offsetY looks large.
_GAZE_DOWN_DELTA = 0.30
# Frames needed before a baseline is trusted. Small enough to settle in the
# first half-minute, large enough not to be set by one odd frame.
