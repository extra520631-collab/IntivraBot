"""Per-field interview rubrics.

A single generic prompt asks a network engineer to "describe a challenging
project" the same way it asks a React developer — which is why interviews felt
identical for every role. Each field here carries what a real interviewer in
that line of work actually probes, and what would be nonsense to ask.

Field ids mirror the candidate-side skill domains in the frontend.
